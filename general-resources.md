# General Resources
This is a collection of resources I have put together over the years that did not warrant their own writeup, but which I did not want to lose.

### The Cynefin Framework 
Pronounced "ki ne vin"

This is a sense-making model, not a categorization model. With sense-making models the data precedes the framework. With categorization models the framework precedes the data. 

It is a decision making framework that helps us figure out how to think, depending on the type of system we're working with (simple, complicated, complex, or chaotic). The middle section of the grid is disorder, where we're trying to decide which category to fall into. 

An interesting note about the line between simple and chaotic, (which is represented as a cliff in a HRB article) is explained by Dave Snowden from the video linked below:

>  ... if you start to believe that things are simple, you start to believe that they're ordered, you start to believe in your own myths, you start to believe that past success means you're invulnerable to future failure, you effectively move to the complacent zone which is the boundary between simple and chaotic and you fall over the edge in a crisis. All the other boundaries allow for transitions. For this you fall over the edge and recovery is very, very expensive. It therefore follows that you should manage in the complicated and complex spaces and only move a very small amount of material down into the simple because that's actually highly vulnerable to rapid or accelerated change.

### The Coming Software Apocalypse
This article explores the vast complexity of our software-driven world and how some people are trying to prevent future catastrophe. 

This quote sums it up well: 
> There will be more bad days for software. It's important that we get better at making it, because if we don't, and as software becomes more sophisticated and connected—as it takes control of more critical functions—those days could get worse.
