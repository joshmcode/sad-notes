# General Resources
This is a collection of resources I have put together over the years that did not warrant their own writeup, but which I did not want to lose.

### The Cynefin Framework 
Pronounced "ki ne vin"

This is a sense-making model, not a categorization model. With sense-making models the data precedes the framework. With categorization models the framework precedes the data. 

It is a decision making framework that helps us figure out how to think, depending on the type of framework we're working with.
